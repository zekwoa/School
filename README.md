# School Database Project

## Description

This project is a comprehensive database for a school, created using MySQL and SQL language.I designed the schema and structured detailed tables and relationships to manage data about students, dependents, teachers, employees, and school activities. The design process included analyzing requirements, creating an Entity-Relationship model, normalizing data to reduce redundancy, defining relationships and constraints, and optimizing with indexing. Custom queries were developed to support school operations, and extensive testing and documentation ensured the database's reliability and usability.

Additionally, the project features custom queries designed to showcase the database's capabilities and facilitate data retrieval for school operations.
